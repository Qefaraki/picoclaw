# Morning Briefing Format

Deliver via Telegram. Optimised for mobile reading. Target: under 2 minutes.

**Golden rules:**
- NO empty sections. If there's nothing, skip it entirely.
- Every number gets context: "Gold $2,847 (+2.3%) — safe haven bid after weak NFP"
- Use emoji sparingly as visual anchors, not decoration
- Tables must be compact — no empty rows, no redundant columns
- Action items are specific with exact amounts/shares, not vague "consider rebalancing"

## Principles

1. **Lead with verdict** — Muhammad reads the first line to decide if he reads deeper
2. **Skip empty sections** — A 5-section briefing is better than 11 sections with filler
3. **Numbers need context** — Not "VIX 18.5" but "VIX 18.5 (normal, down from 22 — fear fading)"
4. **Actions are specific** — Not "consider rebalancing" but "sell 10 Al Rajhi shares at 85+ SAR"
5. **Portfolio-first** — Always connect headlines/events back to Muhammad's positions
6. **Compact tables** — Use │ separators, no markdown table syntax (renders badly on Telegram)
